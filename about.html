              Glass Animals are an English indie rock band formed in Oxford in
              2010. Founded and led by singer, songwriter, and producer Dave
              Bayley, the group also features his <br />
              childhood friends Joe Seaward, Ed Irwin-Singer and Drew
              MacFarlane. Bayley wrote and produced all three Glass Animals
              albums. Bayley spent his childhood in <br />Massachusetts and
              Texas[3] before relocating to Oxford, where he met the other band
              members at school.[4] Their first album, Zaba (2014), spawned the
              single <br />“Gooey”, which was eventually certified platinum in
              the United States. Their second full album, How to Be a Human
              Being, received positive reviews and won in <br />two categories
              at the 2018 MPG Awards for UK Album of the Year and Self Producing
              Artist of the Year, as well as a spot on the Mercury Prize
              shortlist. The third,
              <br />
              Dreamland, peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart and number
              seven on the US Billboard 200.

              Joseph "Joe" Seaward is the drummer for the English psychedelic
              pop band, Glass Animals. Joe was born on October 22nd, 1988. He is
              currently 33 years old. He met the lead singer, Dave Bayley, in
              secondary school after Bayley moved to Oxford, UK from the USA.
              Along with meeting Dave in secondary school, Joe also met the
              other two future members of Glass Animals, Drew MacFarlane, and
              Edmund Irwin-Singer. Joe said he had never really intended to be a
              musician, but Dave managed to coax him into it, saying that they
              could try it out for a year and if it didn't work out, they would
              stop. They eventually produced their first studio album, ZABA, and
              then went on to make How to be a Human Being and Dreamland.

              in England. He plays the bass and keys and sometimes helps with
              backing vocals. He is a pretty shy person compared to the rest of
              the group, he doesn't talk much in interviews, and he doesn't have
              any other job experience.
